/**
 * The basic idea behind KMPâ€™s algorithm is:
 * whenever we detect a mismatch (after some matches),
 * we already know some of the characters in the text of the next window.
 * We take advantage of this information to avoid matching the characters that we know will anyway match.
 *
 * how to know how many characters to be skipped.
 * we pre-process pattern and prepare an integer array lps[] that tells us the count of characters to be skipped
 */

/**
 * Preprocessing Overview
 * There are two arrays, one is pat[] and the other is lps[] which size is m (same as the size of the pattern) using to skip characters
 * lps[i] stores the length of the maximum matching proper prefix
 *
